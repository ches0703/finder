Embedded Software Project

## Description
This repository contains the embedded software project called "finder." The project focuses on controlling LED and motor components through a main program.

## Components
The project consists of the following components:

### LED
The LED component allows for controlling the illumination using software commands. It provides functionalities such as turning the LED on or off, adjusting brightness, and changing colors.

### Motor
The motor component enables the control of a motor using software commands. It allows for setting the speed, direction, and other motor-related operations.

### Main
The main program is the central module that coordinates the functionality of the LED and motor components. It includes the necessary initialization, configuration, and control logic to integrate the LED and motor functionalities.

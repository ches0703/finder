Embedded Software Project

## Description
This repository contains the embedded software project called "finder." The project focuses on controlling __LED__ and __MOTOR__ `driver modules` through a main program.

1. __Target System Kernel Install__ - How to install the kernel on the Raspberry Pi 4B used in the project

    reference : https://wikidocs.net/3243 is how the kernel is built.

2. __Components__ - The project consists of the following components:

    `Motor` : The motor component enables the control of a motor using software commands. It allows for setting the speed, direction, and other motor-related operations.

    `LED` : The LED component allows for controlling the illumination using software commands. It provides functionalities such as turning the LED on or off, adjusting brightness, and changing colors.


## Getting Started
Follow the steps below to get started with the "finder" project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies and libraries, if any.
3. Connect the LED and motor components to the target hardware according to the provided documentation.
4. Build and upload the software to the embedded system.
5. Run the main program to start controlling the LED and motor.
